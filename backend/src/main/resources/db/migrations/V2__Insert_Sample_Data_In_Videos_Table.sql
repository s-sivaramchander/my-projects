Lyrics:
Be my woman, girl, I''mma
Be your man
Be my woman, girl, I''ll
Be your man

Yes I be your woman
Yes I be your baby
Yes I be whatever that you tell me when you ready
Yes I be your girl, forever your lady
You ain''t never gotta worry, I''m down for you baby

Best believe that when you need that
I''ll provide that you will always have it
I''ll be on deck keep it in check
When you need that I''mma let you have it

You beatin'' drum like dum di di dey
I love the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like hey mama mama hey mama mama (Hey)
Banging the drum like dum di di dey
I know you want it in the worst way
I wanna hear you calling my name
